## Image Viewer Example Application ##

This is a simple but fully functional image viewer application with a "gallery view" page
and another for viewing a full size image with adjustable scaling, rotation, and zoom factors. 
This example is primarily meant to demonstrate usage of the [StackOverlayLayout][1].
